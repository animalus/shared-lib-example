## Install

    npm i

## Debug

Sandbox is set up for libraries. To run the sandbox and test the library code do one of the following.

### Web

    gulp dev

This sets up a watch for pug files and runs `ng serve` which itself watches for typescript, scss, and html changes. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200`.

### Mobile

    gulp dev:android
    gulp dev:ios

## Build libraries

We can compile these libraries (both web and nativescript)
